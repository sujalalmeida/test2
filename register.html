                <b>Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEAs)</b><br>
                Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEAs) are short emergency messages from authorized federal, state, local, tribal
                and territorial public alerting authorities that can be broadcast from cell towers to any WEA‐enabled mobile
                device in a locally targeted area. WEAs can be sent by state and local public safety officials, the National
                Weather Service, the National Center for Missing and Expoited Children and the President of the United
                States.
                WEAs look like text messages but are designed to get your attention with a unique sound and vibration
                repeated .<br>
                As are no more than 360 characters and include the type and time of the alert, any action you should take
                and the agency issuing the alert.<br>
                WEAs are not affected by network congestion and will not disrupt texts, calls or data sessions that are in
                progress.<br>
                You are not charged for receiving WEAs and there is no need to subscribe. <br>
                <b>Emergency Alert System (EAS)</b><br>
                The Emergency Alert System (EAS) is a national public warning system that allows the president to address
                the nation within 10 minutes during a national emergency. State and local authorities may also use the
                system to deliver important emergency information such as weather information, imminent threats, AMBER
                alerts and local incident information targeted to specific areas.

            <p class="description"><b>Floods</b>
                <b>Flooding is a temporary overflow of water onto land that is normally dry. Floods are the most common
                    disaster in the United States. Failing to evacuate flooded areas or entering flood waters can lead to
                    injury or death.</b>
    
                Floods may:<br>
                - Result from rain, snow, coastal storms, storm surges, and overflows of dams and other water systems.<br>
                - Develop slowly or quickly. Flash floods can come with no warning.<br>
                - Cause outages, disrupt transportation, damage buildings, and create landslides.<br>
    
                <b>If you are under a flood warning:</b><br>
                - Find safe shelter right away.<br>
                - Do not walk, swim, or drive through flood waters. Turn Around, Don't Drown!<br>
                - Remember, just six inches of moving water can knock you down, and one foot of moving water can sweep your
                vehicle away.<br>
                - Stay off bridges over fast-moving water.<br>
                - Evacuate if told to do so.<br>
                - Move to higher ground or a higher floor.<br>
    
                <b>Preparing for a Flood</b><br>
                <b>Purchase Flood Insurance</b><br>
                - Purchase or renew a flood insurance policy. Homeowner’s insurance policies do not cover flooding. It
                typically takes up to 30 days for a policy to go into effect, so the time to buy is well before a disaster.
                Get flood coverage under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).<br>
    
                <b>Preparing for a Flood</b><br>
                - Make a plan for your household, including your pets, so that you and your family know what to do, where to
                go, and what you will need to protect yourselves from flooding. Learn and practice evacuation routes,
                shelter plans, and flash flood response. Gather supplies, including non-perishable foods, cleaning supplies,
                and water for several days, in case you must leave immediately or if services are cut off in your area.<br>
    
                <b>In Case of Emergency</b><br>
                - Keep important documents in a waterproof container. Create password-protected digital copies. Protect your
                property. Move valuables to higher levels. Declutter drains and gutters. Install check valves. Consider a
                sump pump with a battery.<br>
    
                <b>Staying Safe During a Flood</b><br>
                - Evacuate immediately if told to evacuate. Never drive around barricades. Local responders use them to
                safely direct traffic out of flooded areas.<br>
                - Stay off bridges over fast-moving water. Fast-moving water can wash bridges away without warning.<br>
                - Stay inside your car if it is trapped in rapidly moving water. Get on the roof if water is rising inside
                the car.<br>
                - Get to the highest level if trapped in a building. Only get on the roof if necessary and once there signal
                for help. Do not climb into a closed attic to avoid getting trapped by rising floodwater.<br>
    
                <b>Staying Safe After a Flood</b><br>
                - Pay attention to authorities for information and instructions. Return home only when authorities say it is
                safe.<br>
                - Wear heavy work gloves, protective clothing, and boots during clean up and use appropriate face coverings
                or masks if cleaning mold or other debris.<br>
                - People with asthma and other lung conditions and/or immune suppression should not enter buildings with
                indoor water leaks or mold growth that can be seen or smelled. Children should not take part in disaster
                cleanup work.<br>
                - Be aware that snakes and other animals may be in your house.<br>
                - Be aware of the risk of electrocution. Do not touch electrical equipment if it is wet or if you are
                standing in water. Turn off the electricity to prevent electric shock if it is safe to do so.<br>
                - Avoid wading in floodwater, which can be contaminated and contain dangerous debris. Underground or downed
                power lines can also electrically charge the water.<br>
                - Use a generator or other gasoline-powered machinery ONLY outdoors and away from windows.<br>

            <a class="toggle-link" href="#">Earthquake </a>
            <p class="description"><b>An earthquake is a sudden, rapid shaking of the ground caused by the shifting of rocks
                    deep underneath the earth’s surface. Earthquakes can cause fires, tsunamis, landslides or avalanches.
                    While they can happen anywhere without warning, areas at higher risk for earthquakes include Alaska,
                    California, Hawaii, Oregon, Puerto Rico, Washington and the entire Mississippi River Valley.</b>
                
                <b>Prepare Before an Earthquake</b><br>
                <b>The best time to prepare for any disaster is before it happens.</b><br>
                - Practice Drop, Cover, and Hold On with family and coworkers.<br>
                - <b>Make an Emergency Plan:</b> Create a family emergency communications plan that has an out-of-state
                contact. Plan where to meet if you get separated. Make a supply kit that includes enough food and water for
                several days, a flashlight, a fire extinguisher, and a whistle.<br>
                - Being prepared allows you to avoid unnecessary excursions and to address minor medical issues at home,
                alleviating the burden on urgent care centers and hospitals.<br>
                - Remember that not everyone can afford to respond by stocking up on necessities. For those who can afford
                it, make essential purchases and slowly build up supplies.<br>
                - <b>Protect Your Home:</b> Secure heavy items in your home like bookcases, refrigerators, water heaters,
                televisions, and objects that hang on walls. Store heavy and breakable objects on low shelves.<br>
                - Consider making improvements to your building to fix structural issues that could cause your building to
                collapse during an earthquake.<br>
                - Consider obtaining an earthquake insurance policy. A standard homeowner’s insurance policy does not cover
                earthquake damage.<br>
    
                <b>Stay Safe During</b><br>
                <b><b>If an earthquake happens, protect yourself right away:</b></b><br>
                - If you are in a car, pull over and stop. Set your parking brake.<br>
                - If you are in bed, turn face down and cover your head and neck with a pillow.<br>
                - If you are outdoors, stay outdoors away from buildings.<br>
                - If you are inside, stay and do not run outside and avoid doorways.<br>
    
                <b>Protect Yourself During Earthquakes</b><br>
                <b>1. Drop (or Lock)</b><br>
                - Wherever you are, drop down to your hands and knees and hold onto something sturdy. If you’re using a
                wheelchair or walker with a seat, make sure your wheels are locked and remain seated until the shaking
                stops.<br>
                <b>2. Cover</b><br>
                - Cover your head and neck with your arms. If a sturdy table or desk is nearby, crawl underneath it for
                shelter. If no shelter is nearby, crawl next to an interior wall (away from windows). Crawl only if you can
                reach better cover without going through an area with more debris. Stay on your knees or bent over to
                protect vital organs.<br>
                <b>3. Hold On</b><br>
                - If you are under a table or desk, hold on with one hand and be ready to move with it if it moves. If
                seated and unable to drop to the floor, bend forward, cover your head with your arms, and hold on to your
                neck with both hands.<br>
    
                <b>Stay Safe After</b><br>
                <b><b>There can be serious hazards after an earthquake, such as damage to the building, leaking gas and
                        water lines, or downed power lines.</b></b><br>
                - Expect aftershocks to follow the main shock of an earthquake. Be ready to Drop, Cover, and Hold On if you
                feel an aftershock.<br>
                - If you are in a damaged building, go outside and quickly move away from the building. Do not enter damaged
                buildings.<br>
                - <b>If you are trapped, send a text or bang on a pipe or wall.</b> Cover your mouth with your shirt for
                protection, and instead of shouting, use a whistle.<br>
                - If you are in an area that may experience tsunamis, go inland or to higher ground immediately after the
                shaking stops. Avoid contact with floodwaters as they can contain chemicals, sewage, and debris.<br>
                - <b>Once you are safe, pay attention to local news reports for emergency information and instructions via
                    battery-operated radio, TV, social media, or from cell phone text alerts.</b><br>
                - Register on the American Red Cross “Safe and Well” website so people will know you are okay.<br>
                - Use text messages to communicate, which may be more reliable than phone calls.<br>
                - Be careful when cleaning up. Wear protective clothing, including a long-sleeved shirt, long pants, work
                gloves, and sturdy thick-soled shoes. Do not try to remove heavy debris by yourself. Use an appropriate mask
                if cleaning mold or other debris. People with asthma and other lung conditions and/or immune suppression
                should not enter buildings with indoor water leaks or mold growth that can be seen or smelled. Children
                should not take part in disaster cleanup work.<br>

            <p class="description">Make a plan today. Your family may not be together if a disaster strikes, so it is
                important to know which types of disasters could affect your area. Know how you’ll contact one another and
                reconnect if separated. Establish a family meeting place that’s familiar and easy to find.
    
                <b>Step 1: Put a plan together by discussing the questions below with your family, friends, or household to

                    and other records is crucial for starting the recovery process quickly and efficiently.</b><br>
                -Gather financial and critical personal, household and medical information.<br>
                -Consider saving money in an emergency savings account that could be used in any crisis. Keep a small amount
                of cash at home in a safe place. It is important to have small bills on hand because ATMs and credit cards
                may not work during a disaster when you need to purchase necessary supplies, fuel or food.<br>
                -Obtain property (homeowners or renters), health and life insurance if you do not have them. Not all
                insurance policies are the same. Review your policy to make sure the amount and types of coverage you have
                meets the requirements for all possible hazards. Homeowners insurance does not typically cover flooding, so
                you may need to purchase flood insurance from the National Flood Insurance Program.<br>

            <p class="description"><b>Plan to Evacuate</b><br>
                <b>Many kinds of emergencies can cause you to have to evacuate. In some cases, you may have a day or two to
                    prepare while other situations might call for an immediate evacuation. Planning is vital to making sure
                    that you can evacuate quickly and safely no matter what the circumstances.</b><br>
                <br>
                <b>Before an Evacuation</b><br>
                - Learn the types of disasters that are likely in your community and the local emergency, evacuation and
                shelter plans for each specific disaster.<br>
                - Plan how you will leave and where you will go if you are advised to evacuate.<br>
                - Check with local officials about what shelter spaces are available for this year.<br>
                - Identify several places you could go in an emergency such as a friend’s home in another town or a motel.
                Choose destinations in different directions so that you have options during an emergency.<br>
                - If needed, identify a place to stay that will accept pets. Most public shelters allow only service
                animals.<br>
                - Be familiar with alternate routes and other means of transportation out of your area.<br>
                - Always follow the instructions of local officials and remember that your evacuation route may be on foot
                depending on the type of disaster.<br>
                - Come up with a family/household plan to stay in touch in case you become separated; have a meeting place
                and update it depending on the circumstance.<br>
                - Assemble supplies that are ready for evacuation. Prepare a “go-bag” you can carry when you evacuate on
                foot or public transportation and supplies for traveling longer distances if you have a car.<br>
                - Keep a full tank of gas if an evacuation seems likely. Keep a half tank of gas in it at all times in case
                of an unexpected need to evacuate. Gas stations may be closed during emergencies and unable to pump gas
                during power outages. Plan to take one car per family to reduce congestion and delay.<br>
                <br>
                <b>During an Evacuation</b><br>
                - Follow recommended evacuation routes. Do not take shortcuts, they may be blocked.<br>
                - Be alert for road hazards such as washed-out roads or bridges and downed power lines. Do not drive into
                flooded areas.<br>
                - Secure your home by closing and locking doors and windows.<br>
                - Unplug electrical equipment such as radios, televisions and small appliances. Leave freezers and
                refrigerators plugged in unless there is a risk of flooding. If there is damage to your home and you are
                instructed to do so, shut off water, gas, and electricity before leaving.<br>
                - Leave a note telling others when you left and where you are going.<br>
                - Wear sturdy shoes and clothing that provides some protection such as long pants, long-sleeved shirts, and
                a hat.<br>
                - Check with neighbors who may need a ride.<br>
                <br>
                <b>After an Evacuation</b><br>
                <b>If you evacuated for the storm, check with local officials both where you’re staying and back home before
                    you travel.</b><br>
                - If you are returning to disaster-affected areas, after significant events prepare for disruptions to daily
                activities and remember that returning home before storm debris is cleared is dangerous.<br>
                - Let friends and family know before you leave and when you arrive.<br>
                - Charge devices and consider getting back-up batteries in case power outages continue.<br>
                - Fill up your gas tank and consider downloading a fuel app to check for outages along your route.<br>
                - Bring supplies such as water and non-perishable food for the car ride.<br>
                - Avoid downed power or utility lines, they may be live with deadly voltage. Stay away and report them
                immediately to your power or utility company.<br>
                - Only use generators outside and away from your home and NEVER run a generator inside a home or garage or
                connect it to your home's electrical system.<br>
